# Algorithm_Analyzer
we  will develop a simple program to measure and display how long their assigned algorithm takes to run on different inputs
Our team member should:
  1. Implement one algorithm (as assigned below).
  2. Run it on arrays of different sizes (e.g., 100, 500, 1000 elements).
  3. Measure the execution time using System.currentTimeMillis() or System.nanoTime().
  4. Display the results in a small table format.
